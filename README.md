# Kidney-classification-using-CNN 

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for kidney classification. The model is trained to classify kidney images into different categories based on medical image datasets.

**Features**

Uses CNN for image classification

Preprocessing and augmentation applied to the dataset

Implements TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

Achieves high accuracy in kidney classification.
