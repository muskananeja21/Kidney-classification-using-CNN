Kidney Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for kidney classification. The model is trained to classify kidney images into different categories based on medical image datasets.

Features

Uses CNN for image classification

Preprocessing and augmentation applied to the dataset

Implements TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning

Achieves high accuracy in kidney classification
